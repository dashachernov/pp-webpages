                <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"><b>Overall, there are about 6 main methods of inserting a medical drug or substance into the body of a patient. Of course, there are many more, but the ones listed below are the most common ones.</b><p></p><br><br>
               
                    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="webphoto16.jpg" class="active"><img src="webphoto16.jpg"></a> 
                </div><br>
                <i><p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">(Image of an IV drip)</p></i> 
                    
                    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"><b>Intravenous</b><br>
                    This is a very common and popular way of giving medicine, such as chemotherapy, place the medicine straight into the vein. It uses an intravenous (IV) pathway<br>
                    <i>How does this work?</i><br>
                    Most likely, a nurse will place the IV needle and tube into the patient. A plastic needle is insurted into the patients lower arm - this causes some discomfort. Hanging on a stand, above, would be a plastic bag with liquid - this is the medicine. From the bag, through the tube and needle, the medicine should (without any problems) enter the bloodstream of the patient. Sometimes, however in very rare cases, a syringe may be used to push the medicine through the tube. Overall, this process (apart from the needle placement) is painless. <br>
                    <i>Analogies</i><br>
                    Alternatively, a central line (a catheter) can be used - this is placed into patients who cannot use an IV or prefer to use a catheter. This is a tube that doctors would place into a large neck vein, groin, chest or arm to provide fluid and medication quickly. These can also be used to take blood tests. Using a central line may even be more convinient as IV tubes can cause irritation in the veins and they can also be very hard to place repeatedly. <i>Short term catheters</i>, these are placed in the patient's hospital room under local anesthesia and are removed before departing the hospital - they are placed for temporary access for providing drugs or medication. <i>Long term catheters</i>, these are inserted into the body for a very long period of time; by making a small incision, doctors will thread the IV line under the skin and into a vein to reach a second small incision a distance from the first (the distance will help prevent any future infection). Typically, these would be placed into the chest wall. Stitches would be made at both sites of the incisions and dressings (a plaster like covering with a large, clear window in the middle) would be frequently changed to also prevent infection. <br>
                    Furthermore, a port can be placed to also access the vein - this is, in other words, a central venous cetheter - commonly known as PIC or PICC lines. Usually, a thin and flexible tube would be placed through a vein the patient's arm. Before this, however, a local anesthesia would be given to numb the space between the shoulder and elbow. After this, the doctor would thread a thin tube into the skin, through a vein in the patient's arm, so that it reaches the vena cava above the heart. The vena cave, or the superior vena cava, is one of the main veins in the venous system. This is sometimes a very long term device, hence it will need to be flushed (essentially washing it), but this will depend from case to case.<br><br></p>

                    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">
                    <b>Oral</b><br>
                    This is a common method of inserting drugs into the body, many people have used this method and it remains a very popular one. Patients can take drugs, through this method, both at home or in hospital.<br>
                    A pill, liquid or capsule is swallowed by the patient. However, understanding the drug dosage prior to taking the medicine is very important as it can lead to serious consequences. Moreover, sometimes if a repeated dosage intake it needed, the patient must understand the time invals between intakes.<br>
                    Examples of oral drug treatment are: painkillers, blood cancer drugs (oral chemotheraphy has the same side effects as IV chemotherapy), vitamins. <br></p><br>

                      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">  
                    <b>Injection</b><br>
                    There are two main/ common types of injection methods: intramuscular and subcutaneous.<br>
                    <i>Intramuscular</i><br>
                    This injection is inserted into the muscle, for example: the arm, leg or buttock. Although the patient may experience a little "pinch", this should not be painful.<br>
                    <i>Subcutaneous</i><br>
                    Differently to intramuscular injections, subcutaneous injections are inserted into the tissue just under the skin. Although the patient may experience a little "pinch", this should not be painful.<br></p><br>
                    
                    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="webphoto19.png" class="active"><img src="webphoto19.png"></a>

                          <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">
                    <b>Intrathecal Therapy</b><br>
                    Some types of diseases spread through the nervous system. To treat such diseases, doctors commonly inject medicine into the spinal canal - this is much more effective for treating hard-to-reach cells in the spinal cord or brain cells.<br>
                    <i>How does this work?</i><br>
                    In this case, doctors will do a lumbar puncture to insert a needle into the spinal cord. By removing spinal fluid, fluids containing chemotherapy or or medicine can be inserted. The removed fluid can be later examined. <br>
                    <i>Analogies</i><br>
                    An Omaya can be placed under the patient's scalp. By doing so, the patient will no longer need a lumbar puncture and they can go home. Treatments will be provided through this device. <br><br></p>
                              
                 <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="webphoto24.jpg" class="active"><img src="webphoto24.jpg"></a>

                    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">
                    <b>Suppositories</b><br>
                    Some type of drugs are best put into the body through the rectum - this includes many medical substances made for children.Suppostories are solid medications that are put into the body throught the rectum. This is used if a person cannot take medication through the mouth because they are having a seizures, unable to swallow oral medication, cannot keep oral medication in their system (they vomit) or they have an issue that blocks oral medications from entering the body. Other reasons for taking suppostories are if the oral form of a medical has a very bad taste, the patient has gastric problems (oral medication will not be effective) and many other reasons that depend on the patient. By putting medication through the rectum may also vary on the speed of adsorbtion and delivary - this is sometimes very important to understand and can also sometimes be preferred.<br>
                    Typically recum suppostories are only an inch long and have a round tip at the end. They are commonly used to treat problems such as: constipation, hemorroids, fevers, anxiety (and other mental health probelms), pain and nausea. <br>
                    To insert rectal suppostories, a medical professional does not need to be present, therefore this can be done at home. However, it should be mentioned that hygienic conditions should be maintained. <br></p><br>

                    <b>Dropping</b><br>
                    This may be one of the most common methods, after oral. Eye drops, nose drops, ear drops; these all use drops to put drugs into the body. This is to treat areas that oral mehods cannot reach or those that are too small/ delicate to treat anyother way. Dropping can be done in the comforsts of home and medication may be bought without the permission from a doctor.<br>
                    To do this method, although it can be done at home, hygienic conditions should be maintained.<br><br>

                <p style="text-align: left;">The true origins of when pharmaceutical science was invented is unknonw, it could date back thousands of millions of years prior to our days - when the first man extracted juice from a plant to heal a wound. It is believed that pharamcy has developed parallel to the development of man.
                However, the first signs of pharmacy are obsereved in Ancient Egypt - physician-priests - and Ancient Greece - Greeks Gods (Asclepsis). <br><br>

                    <b>Prehistoric Pharmacy.</b><br>
                There is no clear evidence of what was used in the prehistoric ere; it is known that man was always surrounded by different natural resource: water, plants, animals, dirt, ect. Through observation and implimenting certain theories, we have come to an idea that the prehisotric man has used trial-and-error to find ways that staifsied his neeeds best. No modern historian knows to what degree of accuracy the prehistoric man understood the functions of the body or what was in it. Nonetheless, archiologists have found bones that were once stripped of flesh and sorted into piles, according to where they were found in the body. Furthermore, there are theoties that prehistoric men were cannibals and, therefore, must have known above interal organs. Through further investigation, scientists have found graves of prehistoric men with healthy but brocken bones, unfortunately these bones were never set (propely treated) - this indicates that at this time period, people did not know how to treat brocken bones. Additionally, in our modern lives, we have an idea of public health and the spreading of diseases. Prehistoric men did not. This could be explaned through the fact that prehistoric men travelled a lot and never stayed in one area for very long, meaning that public health was not very relevant to them. <br><br>

                    <b>Ancient Babylonia.</b><br>
                Ancient Mesopotamia is said to be centered around Babylon. This is were to fist recoreded practices of apothacracy (a termn used to describe a person who gives doctors their medication; modern day pharmasist can be called this). Compared to our modern day where docotrs treat the ill, in Ancient Babylonia priests handeled all the healing and treatments. Moreover, their ways of treatments revolved around magic, trial-and-error, the supernatural and spiritual practices. Furthermore, it was here, in Ancient Mesopotamia where clay tablets were invented - the first recorded pill. Ancient Bablylonian priests took time and effort to record their teatments, unfortuntaley their methods or ingrediants would proove ineffectiveness in the modern day. In addition, through records from this time, it can be seen that mesopotamians had knowledge of the locations of some organs. In folk songs, the words "liver" and "heart" can be heard. Nonetheless, their knowledge of their functions were very limited. Their records also show attempts fo treatment of: digestion problems, respiratory problems, mental disorders and even epilepsy. To treat these problems, they have used medication in forms of pills, oils, creams and remedies; often they were made from plants or animal parts. For example, a common cure for "sun-disease" (which would mostly likely be sunbunr) would be to "blow" pills into the ill person's body. In our world, we would mostly likely use soothing or clooling creams. As mentinoed above, another from of treatment woudl be through the use of magic or the supernatural, this is where potential "witches" or "wizards" would directly speak to a prolematic area of an ill person's body in hopes that the evil would fly our under the pressure of the sorcery.  <br><br>

                    <b>Ancient China.</b><br>
                    At one point of time/ history, Ancient China was the leader of medical development. The first types of medical treatment in Ancient China, are thought to have started in around about 2000 B.C. (Before Christ), when an emperor who had started to look into the medical values of many different herbs. It has been heard that he may have tested many of his medical treatments on him self. His main recsources include: wood-bark, leaves, roots, flowers and other plant parts. This herbal medicine is still used in China, to this day. It must be outlined that a major factor of Ancient Chinese medical development was revolving around the, world-famous, Yin-Yang. This is a symbol consisting of two sides - balck and white. The black, the Yin, is thought to be associated with the dark or night; the white, the Ying, is associated with light and day. Both are needed to "balance" each other out. Ancient Chinese doctors, believed that when a person was sick, the balance within their body was lost and in order to treat the person, the balance must be restored by using medicine (e.g. herbal treatments). Another important factor upon which medicine was produce and/ or investigated was through the understanding of "chi". This is the energy of life. It was also said by doctors that when a person was sick, their life balance was unbalanced. <br><br>

                    <b>Ancient Greece</b><br>
                    A man called Theophrastus, was a philosopher in Ancient Greece in around 300 B.C. Hippocrates also worked in this field. Due to this worktowards herbal medicine and treatments, Theophrastus was given the nick name of "Father of Botany." These two men, both, took time to obsereve and record how different herbs would affect people with different illnesses. Theophrasis would also take the effort to lecture them about nature and the different qualities plants hold. All of this knowledge was written cut into slabs of ivory. Suprisingly, their noted observations, compared to modern-day medicine, are quite accurate. 
                    Furthermore, they have started to make diagnosis and statements regarding an individuals health. For example, a person was soon about to die if they had: sunken or blurry eyes, unusually dry facial skin, very pale skin and cold ears. Many modern-day medical terms came from Ancient Greece, such as, but not limited to: acute, chronic, epidemic and pneuma. 
                    Moreover, Ancient Greek doctors made many different treatments, based on the effects of herbs and a person's illness. Chest disease was treated by taking vineger, honey and barley soup; bringing up/ out the phlegm. Also, Pneumonia was treated by giving the patient a bath to help warm up and hopefully bring out the phlegm; the pateint was obliged to stay still during this process. Finally, it should be mentioned that Ancient Greeks used correct methods of treatments, eventhough they though they worked for the wrong reasons. They kept patients, who had a cold, warm and they did blood-lettings for patients who had balance in blood. 
                    Lastly, Ancient Greece had a very rich religion, consisting of many Gods. When a pateint was ill, relatives and doctors would pray to Gods for their healing. <br><br>

                    <b>Italy</b><br>
                    In the 17th century, public pharmacies started to appear in Italy. In 1240 A.D. Italy introduced the idea of seperating Pharmacy and Medicine. Fredrick II of Hohenstaufen had ordered his subjects to seperate responsibilities, so that Pharmacicts and Medics could build their profession in more detail. <br><br>

                    <b>19th Century</b><br>
                    From the very start of the 19th century, pharmacy was built on top of discovries and innvovation made in the centuries prior. Diseases were concluded upon the syptoms they carried and doctors worked on the thought that the drug treating the disease should as strong as the disease. Bloodletting had fought its way to the popular charts of surgeon's treatments. Their method was to let the patient bleed until they faint and then give them enough calomel (mercurous chloride) for them to drool and consequently vomit. This was done to clean the stomach and bowels from toxins and poisons. Of course, this was showed to be inefficient due to its violence. <br><br>
                    In the second half of the 19th century, there was the industrial revolution - this brought more innovation to medical equipment. Moreover, botanical and herbal treatments became popular once again. In 1860, cocaine was made from coca leaves; salicylic acid was extracted from willow bark in 1874 to make aspirin, quinine (a treatment for maleria) was extracted from China bark, however the subcomponent was not formulated until 1883. Nonetheless, no major breakthrough 
                    
                    The century came to a close with two synthesised drugs that are very common in our world today: antipyrin (1883) and aspirin (1897). The creation of these two would later build the bases of, what we call, the Pharmaceutical Century. Furthermore, with more and more knowledge on microbial pathogens and vaccine technology, the first steps were taken to place pharmacy and medicine onto a scientific level or foundation.<br><br>

                <b>20th Century</b><br>
                    In this moment in history, there were huge amounts of innovation happening, this is partly due to the improvement of communication between countries and scientists. Through computers, phone calls and international publications scientists were able to learn from each other and implement different techniques into their own pharmaceutical experiemnts. However, this teamwork and communication has made it harder to say what drugs or methods were made by whom because scientists did not work in isolation anymore.<br>
                    Main advancements that were made were in fighting infection, improving our understanding of nutrition, endocrinology and other aspects.<br>
                    World War 1 and World War 2 had given scientists new knowledge on cell biology and treatment. As well as new understandings on disease and virus treatment. This new knowledge meant that diagnostic tests and advanced treatments were created to improve therapies and body functions - this all happened in tight teamwork with biomedical engineers. Ultrasounds, nuclear magnetic resonance and computerized axial tomography were all created in the 20th century when doctors understood that lasers and other light techniques could be used to look into body tissue.<br>
                    Germany played a big part in medical innovation in the 20th century. A German student found and did research on lead poisening. The same student did a lot of work with testing out different chemcials on the organisms of a diverse of diseases. Working with a fellow peer, the German student made progress into creating the world's first chemotherapy, this helped revolutionize control and treatment of disease.<br>
                    The start of the penicillin era had started in this century. <br>
                    It is very important to note that people in this century, the human's immune system started to be discovered. Edward Jenner, after many experiments, research papers and discussions, had introduced vaccination, specifically against smallpox. Over half a century was taken to produce vaccines that were safe and, mostly importantly, effective.<br>
                    Finally, insulin was brought into the medical world. For about 30 years, scientists wondered about the causes and maybe possible treatments for diabtes. In 1889, two German scientists took dog pancreases to artifically make the disease. In 1901, an American scientist noticed the way of how cells work during diabetes. In further tests and experiments, especially in endocrinology, insulin was found.<br>
                
                    As for the UK, in 1948, the NHS was created by health secretary - Aneurin Bevan. This gave people in the UK free healthcare and this brought more attention to community pharmacies because of the large amount of prescriptions. <br><br>

                <b>21st Century</b><br>
                    In the 21st Century, in the very world we live in today, pharmacy is a very large and well innovated industry. Usually, since we now have a lot of different medical sectors (each playing their own part) the pharamceutical industry has shrunk by a little bit. Now, pharaceutical works helps average citizens work their way around the very busy and confusing work of medicine; prescribing and advising different medicine and different ways of putting into our body. Sometimes it is best to put cream on a sore, however sometimes it is best to take a pill or install an IV drip.<br>
                    In the UK, there is The Royal Society of Pharmacy. This society records the history of British pharmacy and store archives with documentations and publications.<br>
                    
                    <i>Furture plans for the UK</i><br>
                In the UK, there are a lot of future plans to bring pharmacists into theh patient world. By the worlds of the Deputy Chief Pharmceutical Officer for NHS in 2019, more pharmacists are planned to be emplyed into the multi-disciplinary teams in PCNs (Primary Care Networks). They have also said that there are some long-term plans coming soon because there is an increase in patient dependancy on pharmacists. 
                <br><br>These long term plans include:
                <li>To give pharmacy workers to take on more roles in the Primary Care Workforce.</li>
                <li>Hospital pharmacists will increase their area of work into the primary care; this will include pharmacist support consultations. </li>
                <li>Pharmacists, specifically community pharmacists, will support the general public to have healthy lives and will provide aid to patients with small/ minor illesses. </li>
                
                
                <br><br>There is a lot to say about our medical world, in fact, it is sometimes confusing to navigate it. It is clear to say that the future is still unknown to us, however due to current situations, virology is making its way up to popularity. Nonetheless, pharamcy will never fade as it is always important ot understand the best ways of putting treatments into the body. <br><br>

                    At first, the images above may not make any sense. However, they are all connected throught the topic of pharmaceutical science. The first image is a photograph/ scan of a vintage medicine bottle label. Compared to modern bottles, at the time the most important factor was advertisement, in our day it is important ot understand what is in the product rather than the pretty design of it.<br><br>
                    The second image is the image from a typical pharmaceutical lab, this is where they woujld test and create new product. In the image, it is shown how a worker is weighing a white power, from the label on the bottle that rests in his hands, we may connote that the power is in fact sodium chloride.<br><br>
                    The next image is a close up picture of a a group of cancer cells. Pharmacology is linked to this because for different cancer treatments, different equipment and methods are needed. As discussed in the "Methods" page, IV drips, injections, intrathecal therapies are used to kill or at least treat cancer. It is best to understand what method should be used with which medicine to get the best possible results.<br><br>
                    Lastly, the fourth image is another image of a vintage medicine bottle label, however looking at the paper quality, the design and the bottle itself, it may be said that this label is even older than the previous one. Cheracol is used to treat coughs, temporarily, or other symptoms caused by the flu. It is not used to treat on-going coughs that come from things like asthema, other chronic diseases, smoking or coughs that carry a lot of mucus. Furthermore, it is not advised for young children to take this medicine.

                 <b><i>The Idea</i></b><br>
                 Hello, my name is Daria and I am the coder, creater and designer of this website. I have decided to code this website for a school project. My initial motivation for this website was the fact that I have a deep interest in both pharmaceutical science and coding (specifically in HTML5, CSS3 and JS).I have started this website in August 2020, however I only started the coding in around November 2020. The website was finished and uploaded in Janruary 2021. <br>
                The aim of this website is to educate average readers on the given topic - pharamceutical sceince. This website features main points from its history, modern ways of putting drugs into the human body, a photo gallery of interesting pictures and ending with an account of all sources used to create the content of this website (in case any reader would also like to read them).<br><br>
                <b><i>The Hobbies</i></b><br>
                In my life I have had a lot of hobbies, ranging from art school and figure skating class, ending with computer science courses.<br><br>
                From my earliest memories of childhood, I can remember ince rinks, ice skates and competition dresses. From the age of 4 and to the age of 14 I trained as a professional figure skater. I loved jumping and skating to music. My mother or father would take to lessons throughout the week, some being at 06:00am and other at 21:00pm. Following this sport hobby, I have also taken part in tennis, swimming, ballet and modern dance. Nevertheless, figure skating remains my top sport.<br><br>
                Moving to another country at the age of 9, I had enrolled into a local art school, where I was tought art history, art composition, pottery, pencil and paint technique. I have learnt many composition techniques and tricks (this is one of the things that had helped me create this website).<br><br>
                I had also started to learn the Chinese language, specifically Mandarin. I have started to learn it with a teacher, in one-to-one lessons once a week. Then I become more interested in the topic and have taken two lessons per week. Up until now, I have been learning Mandarin for 3 years now. I very much enjoy it because I like exploring new aspects of languages from around the world - I have learnt things that I have never known when learning Chinese and it is something that I will keep with myself for the rest of my life. <br><br> 
                I have enjoyed each and every course I have taken in my past life, however there was a major course that had got me interested in coding. When returing from another figure skating lesson, my mother had started talking about how computers and technology has advanced our lives in a small period of time. Talking about this for some time, my family had thought of placing me into a local coding class that was, at the time, focusing on HTML5 and CSS3. Enrolling into this class, I had low hopes, I had never looked into coding, nor did I enjoy it. Nevertheless, after some lessons of theory and practical work, I started to get the hang of things and really started to take interest in the course. Weeks had passed and I would start making my own little websites at time, for fun. I have had this spirit for coding ever scince and this was one of the major motivations of this website. I enjoy coding because I love watching things being created and I love creating these things myself, with coding, i am able to do this. If I had the chance, I would recommend more people to go into coding as it is a fantasic way of not only growing your knowledge but it also alows you to understand the world around you in more detail. <br><br>
                On the other hand, I have an equal amount of interest in pharmaceutical sceince. My sister-in-law is a doctor. When visitng her I would always look over textbooks, read her magazines and open newspaper articles. I am, since that time, intrigued in the human body and how it can be affected. However, apart from my sister-in-law who is interested in how the human body functions, I am interested in what exactly affects it. This too was a huge push for me to create such a website.<br><br>
